**In traditional programming:**
- the data and functions (subroutines, procedures) are kept seperate from the data they process;
- data must be initialized with suitable values;
- suitable data must be passed to a function when it is called;
- functions must be modified according to the changes of data.


**OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):**
- combines data (properties) and functions (capacities);
- these combinations are placed within an objects' class.


**Advantages of OOP:**
- reduced susceptibility to errors: an object controls access to its own data. More specifically, an object can reject erroneous access attempts;
- easy re-use: objects maintain themselves and can therefore be used as building blocks for other programs;
- low maintenance requirement: an object type can modify its own internal data representation without requiring changes to the application.
